Integrate your Instagram images and your WordPress blog with automatic posting of new images into blog posts.

== Description ==

The Instagrate to WordPress plugin allows you to automatically integrate your Instagram account with your WordPress blog.  

No more manual embedding Instagram images into your posts, let this plugin take care of it all.

Install the plugin. Log in to Instagram, pick your default WordPress post settings, and you are done. Take a photo or lots on Instagram. The next time someone visits your site, a new post will be created with your each photo from Instagram. 

**Please note this plugin supersedes InstaPost Press, which has been discontinued because of a naming conflict. If you installed this plugin you will need to deactivate it before you can use this new plugin. Instagrate to WordPress has new features and will continue to be developed**

* Helpful feed of images in the admin screen.
* Option to manually set the last image in the feed, so all later images will be posted.
